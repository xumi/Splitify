# Splitify

### Why ?
Splitify is a jQuery plugin and require jQuery 
- jQuery support: 1.4+

It's useful when you have simple data in an inputbox (input, textarea) separated by commas (or anything else, thanks to the advanced configuration) and you wanna display them as nice inputs easiely updatable by your users.

For documentation and  examples see:

### How To Use
Add Splitify to your page
    &lt;script src="/javascripts/jquery/splitify.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Call jQuery splitify method on input or textarea elements containing a list of values

It's done!

Advanced configuration details will come in the next days (hopefully)!
